# ML-logistics-Regression-project

•	Trained a Logistic Regression model on the Breast Cancer dataset using Scikit-learn, achieving 96% accuracy in classifying malignant and benign tumors.
•	Performed data preprocessing, including feature scaling with StandardScaler and an 80/20 train-test split, ensuring reliable model evaluation.
•	Assessed model performance using confusion matrix, precision (94%), recall (97%), and F1-score (95%), and visualized results with Seaborn heatmaps.
